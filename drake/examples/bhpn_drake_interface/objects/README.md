This directory contains URDF or SDF files that describe the BHPN test objects with matching names. Initially, I (Tristan Thrush) tried to inject the shapes of BHPN objects into drake automatically, but BHPN does not specify inertia information. It would take considerable effort to add inertia tags to every new BHPN object you want to create (and could be unnecessary if you don't want to use the Drake interface). So I have opted for the design decision of not auto generating BHPN objects for Drake but keeping a dictionary of BHPN object types that Drake knows about.
